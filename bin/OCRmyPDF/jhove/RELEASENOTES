RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.9

GENERAL

1. Jhove.java and JhoveView.java now get their version information from 
   JhoveBase.java. Before it was redundantly kept in three places, and 
   sometimes they didn't all get updated for a new release. Like in 1.8.
   
2. ConfigWriter was in the package edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.viewer, which 
   caused a NoClassDefFoundError if non-GUI configurations didn't include
   JhoveViewer.jar in the classpath. It's been moved to
   edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.

3. Added script packagejhove.sh and made md5.pl part of the CVS repository
   to make packaging for delivery easier.

4. jhove.bat now simply uses the Java command rather than requiring
   the user to set up the Java path.

5. JhoveView.jar and jhove (the top level shell script) are now forced
   by ant to be executable so there are no mistakes.

6. Warning message given on invalid buffer size string, and minimum 
   buffer size is 1024.

7. Configuration file code for adding handlers and giving init strings 
   to modules was an awful mess that never could have worked. 
   Major repairs done.
   
AIFF MODULE

1. If an AIFF file was found to be little-endian, the module instance
   would stay in little-endian mode for all subsequent files. This
   has been fixed.
   
TIFF MODULE

1. TIFF files that had strip or tile offsets but no corresponding byte
   counts were throwing an exception all the way to the top level. Now
   they're correctly being reported as invalid.
   
XML MODULE

1. Cleaned up reporting of schemas, Added some small classes to replace
   the use of string arrays for information structures. Made URI comparison
   for local schema parameter case-independent. Resolved conflict between
   "s" and "schema" parameters.

WAVE MODULE

1.  Some uncaught exceptions caused the module to throw all the way
    back to JhoveBase and not report any result for certain defective
    files. These now report the file as not well-formed. 


RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.8

GENERAL

1. If JHOVE doesn't find a configuration file, it creates a default one.

2. Generics widely added to clean up the code.

3. build.xml files fixed to force compilation to Java 1.5.

4. Shell script "jhove" no longer makes you figure out where JAVA_HOME is.

PDF MODULE

1. Several errors in checking for PDF-A compliance were corrected. Aside from
   fixing some outright bugs, the Contents key for non-text Annotations is
   no longer checked, as its presence is only recommended and not required.

2. Improved code by HÃ¥kan Svenson is now used for finding the trailer. 

TIFF MODULE

1. TIFF tag 700 (XMP) now accepts field type 7 (UNDEFINED) as well as 1 
   (BYTE), on the basis of Adobe's XMP spec, part 3.
   
2. If compression scheme 6 is used in a file, an InfoMessage will report
   that the file uses deprecated compression.

WAVE MODULE

1. The Originator Reference property, found in the Broadcast Wave Extension
   (BEXT) chunk, is now reported.

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.7
2012-08-12

GENERAL

1. JHOVE 1.7, as well as future releases unless noted otherwise, is 
   released independently of Harvard under the GNU General Public License.

2. JHOVE now will tell you where it was looking for the config file if it 
   can't open it. This should help debug configuration problems.

XML HANDLER

1. Changes to XmlHandler.java and NisoImageMetadata.java to correct invalid MIX 
   2.0 XML output in the value of grayResponseUnit. It was previously writing 
   integers (as in 1.0) rather than the expected enumerated strings.

PDF MODULE

1. A situation that caused an infinite loop and eventual memory exhaustion 
   processing in some PDF files with malformed literals has been fixed.
 
RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.6
2011-01-03

XML HANDLER AND TEXT HANDLER

1. The default version of MIX is now 2.0. In earlier versions it was 0.2.
   However, MIX 2.0 still isn't supported in the text handler, so it will
   produce 1.0 output by default. The XML handler will produce MIX 2.0
   output.
   
TIFF MODULE

1. JHOVE returned a \"String index out of range: 4\" exceptions during 
   TIFF validation for a tiff contains an empty (not NULL) date/time 
   field. This has been corrected so that a date/time field with
   the wrong length won't be parsed but will report an error instead.
   
2. If text tags contain characters which aren't printable ASCII, these
   are now output as escape sequences so that invalid XML isn't
   output.

UTF-8 MODULE

1.  Updated to Unicode 6.0.0.

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.5
2009-12-17

PDF MODULE

1. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown on a PDF with an invalid 
   object number in the cross-reference stream. In JHOVE 1.5, this is
   correctly reported as a violation of well-formedness.

UTF-8 MODULE   

1. With some very simple UTF-8 files, JHOVE handlers would throw an exception
   processing them, and the GUI would fail silently. This happened with files
   using no UTF-8 blocks. This has been fixed.

TEXTMD (multiple modules)

1. TextMD metadata can now optionally be reported. To get this, it's
   necessary to edit jhove.conf. TextMD can be enabled on a per-module
   basis for HtmlModule, AsciiModule, Utf8Module, and XmlModule.  
   The <module> element for each chosen module must contain the element
   <param>withtextmd=true</param> (no spaces).
   
2. The TextMD feature was added by Thomas Ledoux.

   
   
RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.4
2009-07-30

PDF MODULE

   1. The PDF/A profile has been updated to the final version of 
      19005-1:2005(E) and made more thorough. Among the changes:

      a. The set-state and no-op actions disqualify a PDF/A candidate.

      b. The ASCIIHexDecode and ASCII85Decode filters no longer 
         disqualify a candidate.

      c. Checking of outlines has been added.

      d. Additional checking of Type 1 fonts and symbolic fonts.

      e. Bug fix in checking type 2 subfonts.

      f. An LZW filter in an image object disqualifies a candidate.

      g. The xpacket processing instruction is checked for attributes 
         which disqualify from PDF/A.

      h. Conformity to implementation limits is checked as a condition
         of PDF/A conformity.

JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. The pathological case of an image with no components is checked so
      it won't cause a crash.

XML HANDLER

   1. A reset() function has been added so that if the handler is reused,
      it will return to a valid initial state.

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.3
2009-06-04

GENERAL

   1. The build.xml files now force compilation to Java 1.4, preventing 
      accidental distributions that aren't 1.4-compatible.
   2. Spaces are allowed in file paths on Windows, if the path is 
      enclosed in quotes. This fix had been in version 1.1i, and had been
      lost since then.
      
PDF MODULE

   1. According to the PDF 1.6 specification, table 3.4, parameters for a 
      stream filter can be either a dictionary or the null object. The null 
      object was treated as an error; it is now allowed.
   2. Object stream handling was seriously buggy, causing rejection of
      well-formed and valid files; it's better now.
   3. In PDF 1.4, an outline dictionary unconditionally must have a "First" 
      and a "Last" entry. JHOVE follows this requirement, declaring a file
      invalid if it isn't met. However, PDF 1.6 relaxes the requirement,
      applying it only "if there are any open or closed outline entries." 
      Thus, an empty outline dictionary with no "First" or "Last" entry 
      is valid. It is now accepted (for all PDF versions).
   4. If a page number tree in a PDF file is missing an expected "Nums" 
      entry, this was being reported as an invalid date. A more appropriate
      error message is now given. 

TIFF MODULE

   1. TIFF tag 33723 (IPTC-NAA) was considered valid only if the data
      type is ASCII or LONG. But according to Aware Systems, the valid
      types are UNDEFINED and BYTE. All four types are now accepted. 

XML HANDLER

   1. Omissions in MIX 1.0 and 2.0 output have been fixed.
   
RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.2
2009-02-10

GENERAL

   1. A bug has been fixed in CountedInputStream, which could potentially
      have caused infinite recursion in some modules.

HTML MODULE

   1. An incompatibility with Java 1.6 has been fixed.
   
PDF MODULE

   1. A null pointer exception would be thrown for PDF documents without a
      document root tree. This has been fixed.
   2. A source of possible false positives in PDF profiles has been fixed.
   3. Certain checks weren't being done to Type 2 fonts, and some PDF/A 
      profile violations might have been missed as a result. This has
      been fixed.
   
WAVE MODULE

   1. Sub-chunks of the 'adtl' chunk are now constrained to even byte
      boundaries.
      
XML HANDLER

   1. MIX 2.0 is now supported.
   2. The URL for the MIX 0.2 schema has changed to reflect the change
      on the LOC MIX site.
   3. The handler was sometimes incorrectly reporting whether the 
      AESAudioMetadata property had an empty value or not. This has
      been fixed.


RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.1 
Rev. 2008-02-22

COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE

   1. Allow filenames with internal spaces if they are quoted on the
      command line.
   2. Corrected error setting the Classpath in the Windows Shell script
      (jhove.bat)
   3. Corrected error opening the configuration file using the default
      GCJ parser in the GNU Java Runtime Environment.

GUI (SWING) INTERFACE (JHOVE VIEW)

   1. AES metadata properties displayed in the RepInfo window rearranged
      slightly to make their ordering consistent with the Text and XML
      handlers.
   2. The JhoveView.main() method will now accept a "-c configFile" option
      on the command line.  The GUI interface can now be invoked by:

          java -jar bin/JhoveView.jar -c configFile

   3. Corrected error opening the configuration file using the default
      GCJ parser in the GNU Java Runtime Environment.
   4. Correct recurrent problems with reading the configuration file on
      Windows installations.

AIFF MODULE

   1. Correct value for first sample offset by included non-zero offset
      defined in the SSND chunk.
   2. Do not report bitrate reduction data for PCM data.
   3. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

ASCII MODULE

   1. A minimal file containing no line-end characters now does not
      produce an empty ASCIIMetadata property, which is invalid against
      the JHOVE schema.
   2. Zero-length files are considered not well-formed.
   3. Issue informative message if file contains no printable characters.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

BYTESTREAM MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

GIF MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

HTML MODULE

   1. The HTMLMetadata block in the module output is only produced if
      there is at least one actual metadata property to report.
   2. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

JPEG MODULE

   1. The JPEG module reports the X and Y sampling frequency for files
      meeting the JFIF profile.
   2. The JPEG module reports the pixel aspect ratio for JFIF profile
      files for which it is defined.
   3. File handles were not being properly closed when processing embedded
      EXIF metadata.  In cases where JHOVE was invoked against large
      numbers of objects this was causing a premature crash due to the
      resource leak.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   5. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   6. Validation errors in embedded EXIF metdata were not being fully
      reported.

JPEG 2000 MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   2. Files generated by the LuraWave codec are no longer incorrecly identified
      as having unrecognized QCC marker segments.

PDF MODULE

   1. Date strings are now parsed with strict conformance to the ASN.1
      syntax.
   2. Destinations defined by indirect references to non-existent objects
      are assumed to have the value "null".  Files containing such
      destinations are reported as "well-formed, but not valid".
   3. No attempt is made to display encrypted outline item title strings are
      not displayed.
   4. Catch error if the Info key of the trailer dictionary is not an 
      indirect reference.
   5. Read entire page tree structure, regardless of its internal
      organization.  This error may have caused the under reporting of
      page resources, such as fonts and images.
   6. The NISO Compression Scheme for all images using the CCITTFaxDecode
      compression filter is now reported properly; previously, the scheme
      was always reported as CCITT 1D even if the actual compression
      algorithm was CCITT Group 3 or 4.
   7. Properly parse UTF-16 escape characters encoded in double-byte form.
   8. The module properly stops looking for the header comment after 1024
      bytes.
   9. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
  10. The number of incremental updates is now reported correctly, rather than
      the total number of file trailers, which is one greater than the number
      of updates.
  11. Only up to 1000 fonts will be reported.  After that, an informative
      message will be generated.  The limit can be set using the parameter
      "nxxxx" in the module-specific section of the configuration file:

          <module>
            <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.PdfModule</class>
            <param>n2000</param>
          </module>

  12. Subfonts of Type 0 are now being properly reported.
  13. PDF/A-1b profile is now being properly reported.
  14. Permit trailer info key to be optional.
  15. Additional correction for outline recursion.
  16. Fix treatment of indirect object of Actions.
  17. Correctly handle trailer dictionary without Info entry.
  18. Ignore comments within dictionaries.

TIFF MODULE

   1. Corrected error parsing pyramidal TIFF using the SubIFDs tag with a
      type of IFD (13) rather than LONG (4).
   7. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   2. All sub-IFDs of a pyramidal TIFF are now properly parsed.
   3. The EXIF GainControl tag (41991) is now correctly identified as
      a SHORT, not a RATIONAL, value.
   4. Corrected error in which valid files were reported as being only
      well-formed due to an incorrect parsing of the DateTime (306) tag.
   5. Byte-aligned offsets can be considered well-formed if the module
      parameter "byteoffset=true" is set in the configuration file:

          <module>
            <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.TiffModule</class>
            <param>byteoffset=true</param>
          </module>

   6. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   7. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   8. Using the "-s" option, the TIFF module was incorrectlly reporting
      signature matches for text files starting with "II".
   9. Validation errors in embedded EXIF metdata were not being fully
      reported.

UTF8 MODULE

   1. Corrected error under which malformed UTF-8 files containing encoding
      sequences starting with a byte value in the range 0xF8 through 0xFF
      were reported as well-formed and valid.
   2. Zero-length files are considered not well-formed.
   3. Issue informative message if file contains no printable characters.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

WAVE MODULE

   1. BWF files now set the correct start time in the AES metadata.
   2. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   3. "cue " and "adtl" chunks are now properly read.

XML MODULE

   1. The DTD is assumed to be the first DOCTYPE system ID in the file with an
      ".dtd" extension.
   2. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   3. The module correctly handles schemaLocation attributes that do not
      provide two whitespace-separated URIs.

TEXT HANDLER

   1. AES audio metadata properties rearranged slightly to make their
      ordering consistent with the XML schema.

XML HANDLER

   1. Correct sample rate formatting in AES Time Code Format (TCF)
      temporal references.
   2. Correct face IDREF in AES metadata.
   3. Disallowed control characters are removed from content.
   4. Null property values no longer generate empty elements.
   5. Image technical metadata can be reported in terms of the MIX 1.0 schema,
      as opposed to the default reporting against MIX 0.2.  To specify the
      1.0 schema include the directive:

          <mixVersion>1.0</mixVersion>

      if the configuration file.

JHOVE API

   1. The process() and processFile() methods of the JhoveBase class are now
      public, to permit direct access to the API by applications.
   2. Checksum calculations now use buffered I/O uniformly for improved
      performance.
   3. All non-final fields and methods in the JhoveBase class are
      protected, rather than private.
   4. When invoked with the "-s" option JHOVE now reports the signature
      matched format and MIME type.
   5. The processing of files in a directory is now performed in an
      alphabetically sorted order.

ADUMP UTILITY

   1. Display the field values of known chunks.

TDUMP UTILITY

   1. New format that sorts all tag definitions by their byte offset and
      also displays the byte ranges for image data.
   2. Command line flags permit the suppression of BYTE data display (-b) and
      and subIFD parsing (-s). 

USERHOME UTILITY

   1. A new utility program, UserHome, is available to determine the value
      of the Java user.home property needed to know where to place the
      configuration file.  This utility can be invoked by the driver scripts
      "userhome" (Bourne shell) or "userhome.bat" (Windows).

************************************************************************

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0
Rev. 2005-05-26

GENERAL

   1. Zero length files are now handled properly in all modules.

   2. Missing start time in audio files is now handled property in all
      audio modules.

   3. Miscellaneous bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation updates.

AIFF MODULE

   1. Corrected error causing BitrateReduction to be incorrectly reported
      for uncompressed PCM audio.


JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. The module now validates the enumerated ICC profile types in the
      Color Specification Box. In the JP2 profile, an unrecognized ICC
      profile type marks the file as not well formed; in the JPX, the file
      is merely not valid.

   2. In the beta 3 release certain invalid JPEG 2000 files were
      reported as well formed in the JP2 profile. This has been corrected.

PDF MODULE

   1. Following the practice of Acrobar, the PDF module will accept
      the "%PDF-1.n" header comment anywhere in the first 1024 bytes of a
      file (with appropriate notification via an information message),
      rather than requiring that it start at byte offset 0.

   2. The requirements for the PDF/A profile have been brought into
      conformance with the most recent version of the PDF/A specification,
      ISO/DIS 19005-1 of 2004-12-22.

   3. Corrected bug that prevented valid PDF/X-1 files from being
      recognized as such.

WAVE MODULE

   1. Corrected error causing BitrateReduction to be incorrectly reported
      for uncompressed PCM audio.

XML HANDLER

   1. Dates reported for the NISO Z39.87 <tt><mix:DateTimeCreated>
      element are now canonicalized to be in proper ISO 8601 form.

   2. The NISO Z39.87 <tt><mix:ScannerManufacturer> element is now
      reported, if known.

AUDIT HANDLER

   1. The current working directory is reported as the "home"
      attribute of the <audit> element and individual files are reported
      as relative pathnames

************************************************************************

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0 (beta 3)
Rev. 2005-02-04

1 GENERAL

   1. The architecture has been modified to simplify the use of JHOVE
      with new "front ends." The new JhoveBase class is used in
      conjunction with the App class to incorporate nearly all the
      work of setting up a JHOVE instance. The main Jhove class and the App
      class are now smaller than before.

   2. Checksums were often being reported with incorrect values due to
      an output formatting error that dropped zeroes. This has been fixed.

   3. New utilities GDUMP and JDUMP created for GIF and JPEG documents.

   4. Error messages are more consistently factored into submessages.
      This allows messages indicating the same type of error to
      be more readily grouped.

   5. Some modules were reporting a MIME type for a document that is
      not well-formed. This no longer occurs.

   6. Duplicate reporting of AES BitDepth has been suppressed.

   7. New module for HTML format. Be sure to update the configuration
      file, jhove/conf/jhove.conf, to include the module:

        ...
        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.HtmlModule</class>
        </module>
        ...

   8. The AES audio metadata representation has been updated to
      conform with schema version 1.02b (pre-release).

   9. New property, sigMatches, has been added to RepInfo. This
      records which module(s) regarded the signature of the document as a
      match, even if the document was not well-formed. This is useful in
      identifying broken documents that are reported as ASCII or Bytestream.

  10. The logging API is supported, permitting the generation of
      debugging messages.

  11. All modules are now non-final, so that they can be subclassed by
      adventurous users.

  12. The -p and -P arguments of the command line are no longer
      supported.  Instead, the equivalent parameters can be
      provided to all variants of JHOVE (including those which
      don't take a command line) by specifying a <param> element
      within the <module> element of the configuration file.
      Example:

        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.PdfModule</class>
         <param>a</param>
         <param>f</param>
         <param>p</param>
        </module>

2 JHOVE COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE

   1. The JHOVE command-line interface can now accept directory names,
      as well as file pathnames and URIs:

        java Jhove [-c config] [-m module] [-h handler] [-e encoding]
                   [-H handler] [-o output] [-x saxclass] [-t tempdir]
                   [-b bufsize] [-l loglevel] [[-krs] dir-file-or-uri [...]]

      All of the files in the directories are processed in a
      depth-first recursive descent.

3 JHOVEVIEWER (SWING GUI) INTERFACE

   1. The JhoveViewer class now allows dragging of a directory or of
      multiple files, and the output for all files is presented in a single
      window. This significantly reduces the window clutter.

   2. The JhoveViewer presents the module menu in alphabetical order
      rather than configuration file order.

   3. The JhoveViewer was failing to report some submessages. This is fixed.

   4. The JhoveViewer was failing silently on certain URL errors; it
      now puts up an error alert.

   5. If an empty module class name is added in the Configuration
      dialog, it is ignored.

4 AIFF MODULE

   1. Descriptive properties added.

   2. Checksum was sometimes missing; fixed.

   3. Specification URL added to descriptive information.

   4. Reported MIME type changed to 'audio/x-aiff' from 'application/aiff'.

5 GIF MODULE

   1. BitsPerSample is now reported.

6 JPEG MODULE

   1. Errors occurring when parsing an optional EXIF segment were not
      being reported. This problem manifested itself by incorrectly
      reporting that the JPEG file is not well-formed.

   2. Array size bug in BitsPerSample fixed.

7 JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. Specification information added for ITU.

   2. Errors in parsing of an EXIF segment are now reported.

8 PDF MODULE

   1. In certain instances the module was inappropriately reporting
      well-formed PDF files as being non-well-formed, indicating
      (incorrectly) that the file does not contain a trailer.

   2. Fixed a NullPointerException being thrown with a defective page
      root tree.

   3. Certain broken cross-reference tables would throw the module
      into a loop. This is fixed.

   4. Problems in XMP data that triggered a SAX error were being
      reported to standard output as a "fatal error." They are now properly
      reported.

   5. Error in offset reporting fixed.

   6. Now reports FontFile2 and FontFile3.

   7. File trailers are now found more reliably.

   8. PDF/A profile updated to latest draft proposal, ISO/CD 19005-1
      (2004-09-20).

   9. Parameters that would have been specified by the -p argument 
      of the command line are now specified by the <param> element 
      in the configuration file. The sense of these parameters 
      has been reversed; by default, the PDF module presents
      the maximum amount of information unless suppressed by
      including the characters a, p, f, or o in the parameter value(s). 

9 TIFF MODULE

   1. Adobe DNG tags are recognized, and a DNG profile has been added.

   2. Bug in DATETIME checking fixed.

   3. Changes in validity tests for PhotometricInterpretation,
      SamplesPerPixel and BitsPerSample.

   4. Corrected spurious null values for some properties.

   5. Tag data type checking was badly broken, now fixed.

10 WAVE MODULE

   1. Type 'exif' recognized in LIST chunk.

   2. Format and signature information updated.

   3. Checksum was sometimes missing; fixed.

   4. Reported MIME type changed to 'audio/x-wave' from 'audio/x-wav'.

11 XML MODULE

   1. Now reports 1.0 and 1.1 as versions rather than profiles.

   2. Reported MIME type changed to 'text/xml' from 'application/xml'.

   3. A base URL for DTD's may now be specified using the 
      <param> element. The URL must be preceded by the letter b 
      to distinguish it from potential future parameters, e.g.,

        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.XmlModule</class>
         <param>bhttp://www.example.com/</param>
        </module>

12 XML HANDLER

   1. The "xsi" namespace is now defined in the NISO Image Metadata
      <mix:mix> and AES Audio Metadata <aes:audioObject> elements. This
      allows these segments to validate when extracted from the JHOVE output
      document.

   2. The <ImagingPerformanceAssessment> element is properly named; it
      had been improperly displayed as <ImagePerformanceAssessment>.

   3. X and YSamplingFrequency are reported as positive integers
      ("600"), not ratios ("600/1"), for consistency with the MIX schema.

   4. An empty Properties element in the XML handler is now suppressed.

13 GDUMP UTILITY

   1. New utility to dump GIF files in human-readable form. 

14 JDUMP UTILITY

   1. New utility to dump JPEG files in human-readable form. 

15 TDUMP UTILITY

   1. The output format has changed slightly, e.g.

       00000000: "II" (little endian) 42
        00000008: IFD 1 with 15 entries
        00000034: 254 (NewSubFileType) LONG 1 = 0
        00000046: 256 (ImageWidth) LONG 1 = 2948
        00000058: 257 (ImageLength) LONG 1 = 4620
        ...

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0 (beta 2)
Rev. 2004-07-19

1. GENERAL

  1.1 Multiple files can now be specified in command line.

         jhove ... [[-krs] file-or-uri ...]

      A single output document (XML or text) will be generated for a
      set of files specified in a command line.

  1.2 API version information is now available through methods in the
      App class.

  1.3 AESAudioMetadata property has been added for sound formats. The
      new PropertyPath class facilitates the extraction of Properties
      by applications that use the JHOVE API.

  1.4 The ErrorMessage and InfoMessage classes now support a submessage
      string for more flexible message factoring.

  1.5 The SAX parser class may now be specified in the jhove.properties
      file in the property "edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.saxClass".

2. GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE (JhoveView)

  2.1 Supports drag and drop of directories; subdirectories are
      processed recursively.

  2.2 The menu option "File > Close document windows" closes all document
      windows.

3. MODULES (GENERAL)

  3.1 Performance has been improved in all modules.

  3.2 New modules for JPEG 2000, AIFF, and WAVE formats.  Be sure to
      update the configuration file, jhove/conf/jhove.conf, to include
      these modules:

        ...
        <module>
          <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.AiffModule</class>
        </module>
        <module>
          <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.WaveModule</class>
        </module>
        <module>
          <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.Jpeg2000Module</class>
        </module>
        ...

  3.3 Bug reading unsigned integers has been fixed.

  7.2 Photoshop tags 34377 and 50255 are now recognized.

  7.3 Bug in handling ExtraSamples tag fixed.

  7.4 Bug in determining valid date/time formats; the range for hours was
      incorrectly constrained to 1-24, rather than 0-24.

8. XML MODULE

  8.1 If no encoding is specified, encoding is now reported as UTF-8.

  8.2 Catches and reports UTFDataFormatException.

  8.3 A greater range of parsers (including Xerces) now will do
      schema validation.

  9.1 Omitted values in NisoImageMetadata were being reported in XML
      in some cases as default values (e.g., -1).  These have been
      suppressed.

  9.2 <PlanarConfiguration> element was inappropriately nested underneath
      the <Segments> element.

  9.3 The "subMessage" attribute is now properly defined in the jhove.xsd
      schema.

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.5
2009-12-17

PDF MODULE

1. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown on a PDF with an invalid 
   object number in the cross-reference stream. In JHOVE 1.5, this is
   correctly reported as a violation of well-formedness.

UTF-8 MODULE   

1. With some very simple UTF-8 files, JHOVE handlers would throw an exception
   processing them, and the GUI would fail silently. This happened with files
   using no UTF-8 blocks. This has been fixed.

TEXTMD (multiple modules)

1. TextMD metadata can now optionally be reported. To get this, it's
   necessary to edit jhove.conf. TextMD can be enabled on a per-module
   basis for HtmlModule, AsciiModule, Utf8Module, and XmlModule.  
   The <module> element for each chosen module must contain the element
   <param>withtextmd=true</param> (no spaces).
   
2. The TextMD feature was added by Thomas Ledoux.

   
   
RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.4
2009-07-30

PDF MODULE

   1. The PDF/A profile has been updated to the final version of 
      19005-1:2005(E) and made more thorough. Among the changes:

      a. The set-state and no-op actions disqualify a PDF/A candidate.

      b. The ASCIIHexDecode and ASCII85Decode filters no longer 
         disqualify a candidate.

      c. Checking of outlines has been added.

      d. Additional checking of Type 1 fonts and symbolic fonts.

      e. Bug fix in checking type 2 subfonts.

      f. An LZW filter in an image object disqualifies a candidate.

      g. The xpacket processing instruction is checked for attributes 
         which disqualify from PDF/A.

      h. Conformity to implementation limits is checked as a condition
         of PDF/A conformity.

JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. The pathological case of an image with no components is checked so
      it won't cause a crash.

XML HANDLER

   1. A reset() function has been added so that if the handler is reused,
      it will return to a valid initial state.

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.3
2009-06-04

GENERAL

   1. The build.xml files now force compilation to Java 1.4, preventing 
      accidental distributions that aren't 1.4-compatible.
   2. Spaces are allowed in file paths on Windows, if the path is 
      enclosed in quotes. This fix had been in version 1.1i, and had been
      lost since then.
      
PDF MODULE

   1. According to the PDF 1.6 specification, table 3.4, parameters for a 
      stream filter can be either a dictionary or the null object. The null 
      object was treated as an error; it is now allowed.
   2. Object stream handling was seriously buggy, causing rejection of
      well-formed and valid files; it's better now.
   3. In PDF 1.4, an outline dictionary unconditionally must have a "First" 
      and a "Last" entry. JHOVE follows this requirement, declaring a file
      invalid if it isn't met. However, PDF 1.6 relaxes the requirement,
      applying it only "if there are any open or closed outline entries." 
      Thus, an empty outline dictionary with no "First" or "Last" entry 
      is valid. It is now accepted (for all PDF versions).
   4. If a page number tree in a PDF file is missing an expected "Nums" 
      entry, this was being reported as an invalid date. A more appropriate
      error message is now given. 

TIFF MODULE

   1. TIFF tag 33723 (IPTC-NAA) was considered valid only if the data
      type is ASCII or LONG. But according to Aware Systems, the valid
      types are UNDEFINED and BYTE. All four types are now accepted. 

XML HANDLER

   1. Omissions in MIX 1.0 and 2.0 output have been fixed.
   
RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.2
2009-02-10

GENERAL

   1. A bug has been fixed in CountedInputStream, which could potentially
      have caused infinite recursion in some modules.

HTML MODULE

   1. An incompatibility with Java 1.6 has been fixed.
   
PDF MODULE

   1. A null pointer exception would be thrown for PDF documents without a
      document root tree. This has been fixed.
   2. A source of possible false positives in PDF profiles has been fixed.
   3. Certain checks weren't being done to Type 2 fonts, and some PDF/A 
      profile violations might have been missed as a result. This has
      been fixed.
   
WAVE MODULE

   1. Sub-chunks of the 'adtl' chunk are now constrained to even byte
      boundaries.
      
XML HANDLER

   1. MIX 2.0 is now supported.
   2. The URL for the MIX 0.2 schema has changed to reflect the change
      on the LOC MIX site.
   3. The handler was sometimes incorrectly reporting whether the 
      AESAudioMetadata property had an empty value or not. This has
      been fixed.


RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.1 
Rev. 2008-02-22

COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE

   1. Allow filenames with internal spaces if they are quoted on the
      command line.
   2. Corrected error setting the Classpath in the Windows Shell script
      (jhove.bat)
   3. Corrected error opening the configuration file using the default
      GCJ parser in the GNU Java Runtime Environment.

GUI (SWING) INTERFACE (JHOVE VIEW)

   1. AES metadata properties displayed in the RepInfo window rearranged
      slightly to make their ordering consistent with the Text and XML
      handlers.
   2. The JhoveView.main() method will now accept a "-c configFile" option
      on the command line.  The GUI interface can now be invoked by:

          java -jar bin/JhoveView.jar -c configFile

   3. Corrected error opening the configuration file using the default
      GCJ parser in the GNU Java Runtime Environment.
   4. Correct recurrent problems with reading the configuration file on
      Windows installations.

AIFF MODULE

   1. Correct value for first sample offset by included non-zero offset
      defined in the SSND chunk.
   2. Do not report bitrate reduction data for PCM data.
   3. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

ASCII MODULE

   1. A minimal file containing no line-end characters now does not
      produce an empty ASCIIMetadata property, which is invalid against
      the JHOVE schema.
   2. Zero-length files are considered not well-formed.
   3. Issue informative message if file contains no printable characters.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

BYTESTREAM MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

GIF MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

HTML MODULE

   1. The HTMLMetadata block in the module output is only produced if
      there is at least one actual metadata property to report.
   2. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.

JPEG MODULE

   1. The JPEG module reports the X and Y sampling frequency for files
      meeting the JFIF profile.
   2. The JPEG module reports the pixel aspect ratio for JFIF profile
      files for which it is defined.
   3. File handles were not being properly closed when processing embedded
      EXIF metadata.  In cases where JHOVE was invoked against large
      numbers of objects this was causing a premature crash due to the
      resource leak.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   5. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   6. Validation errors in embedded EXIF metdata were not being fully
      reported.

JPEG 2000 MODULE

   1. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   2. Files generated by the LuraWave codec are no longer incorrecly identified
      as having unrecognized QCC marker segments.

PDF MODULE

   1. Date strings are now parsed with strict conformance to the ASN.1
      syntax.
   2. Destinations defined by indirect references to non-existent objects
      are assumed to have the value "null".  Files containing such
      destinations are reported as "well-formed, but not valid".
   3. No attempt is made to display encrypted outline item title strings are
      not displayed.
   4. Catch error if the Info key of the trailer dictionary is not an 
      indirect reference.
   5. Read entire page tree structure, regardless of its internal
      organization.  This error may have caused the under reporting of
      page resources, such as fonts and images.
   6. The NISO Compression Scheme for all images using the CCITTFaxDecode
      compression filter is now reported properly; previously, the scheme
      was always reported as CCITT 1D even if the actual compression
      algorithm was CCITT Group 3 or 4.
   7. Properly parse UTF-16 escape characters encoded in double-byte form.
   8. The module properly stops looking for the header comment after 1024
      bytes.
   9. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
  10. The number of incremental updates is now reported correctly, rather than
      the total number of file trailers, which is one greater than the number
      of updates.
  11. Only up to 1000 fonts will be reported.  After that, an informative
      message will be generated.  The limit can be set using the parameter
      "nxxxx" in the module-specific section of the configuration file:

          <module>
            <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.PdfModule</class>

  16. Fix treatment of indirect object of Actions.
  17. Correctly handle trailer dictionary without Info entry.
  18. Ignore comments within dictionaries.

TIFF MODULE

   1. Corrected error parsing pyramidal TIFF using the SubIFDs tag with a
      type of IFD (13) rather than LONG (4).
   7. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   2. All sub-IFDs of a pyramidal TIFF are now properly parsed.
   3. The EXIF GainControl tag (41991) is now correctly identified as
      a SHORT, not a RATIONAL, value.
   4. Corrected error in which valid files were reported as being only
      well-formed due to an incorrect parsing of the DateTime (306) tag.
   5. Byte-aligned offsets can be considered well-formed if the module
      parameter "byteoffset=true" is set in the configuration file:

          <module>
            <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.TiffModule</class>
            <param>byteoffset=true</param>
          </module>

   6. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than
      private.
   7. Correct parsing of the EXIF "subsecTimeOriginal" (37251) and
      "subsecTimeDigitized" (37522) properties.
   8. Using the "-s" option, the TIFF module was incorrectlly reporting
      signature matches for text files starting with "II".
   9. Validation errors in embedded EXIF metdata were not being fully
      reported.

UTF8 MODULE

   1. Corrected error under which malformed UTF-8 files containing encoding
      sequences starting with a byte value in the range 0xF8 through 0xFF
      were reported as well-formed and valid.
   2. Zero-length files are considered not well-formed.
   3. Issue informative message if file contains no printable characters.
   4. All non-final instance fields and methods are protected, rather than

      private.
   3. The module correctly handles schemaLocation attributes that do not
      provide two whitespace-separated URIs.

TEXT HANDLER

   1. AES audio metadata properties rearranged slightly to make their
      ordering consistent with the XML schema.

XML HANDLER

   1. Correct sample rate formatting in AES Time Code Format (TCF)

   2. Correct face IDREF in AES metadata.
   3. Disallowed control characters are removed from content.
   4. Null property values no longer generate empty elements.
   5. Image technical metadata can be reported in terms of the MIX 1.0 schema,
      as opposed to the default reporting against MIX 0.2.  To specify the

          <mixVersion>1.0</mixVersion>

      if the configuration file.

JHOVE API

   1. The process() and processFile() methods of the JhoveBase class are now
      public, to permit direct access to the API by applications.
   2. Checksum calculations now use buffered I/O uniformly for improved
      performance.
   3. All non-final fields and methods in the JhoveBase class are
      protected, rather than private.
   4. When invoked with the "-s" option JHOVE now reports the signature
      matched format and MIME type.
   5. The processing of files in a directory is now performed in an
      alphabetically sorted order.

ADUMP UTILITY

   1. Display the field values of known chunks.

TDUMP UTILITY

   1. New format that sorts all tag definitions by their byte offset and
      also displays the byte ranges for image data.
   2. Command line flags permit the suppression of BYTE data display (-b) and
      and subIFD parsing (-s). 

USERHOME UTILITY

   1. A new utility program, UserHome, is available to determine the value
      of the Java user.home property needed to know where to place the
      configuration file.  This utility can be invoked by the driver scripts
      "userhome" (Bourne shell) or "userhome.bat" (Windows).

************************************************************************

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0
Rev. 2005-05-26

GENERAL

   1. Zero length files are now handled properly in all modules.

   2. Missing start time in audio files is now handled property in all
      audio modules.

   3. Miscellaneous bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation updates.

AIFF MODULE

   1. Corrected error causing BitrateReduction to be incorrectly reported
      for uncompressed PCM audio.


JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. The module now validates the enumerated ICC profile types in the
      Color Specification Box. In the JP2 profile, an unrecognized ICC
      profile type marks the file as not well formed; in the JPX, the file
      is merely not valid.

   2. In the beta 3 release certain invalid JPEG 2000 files were
      reported as well formed in the JP2 profile. This has been corrected.

PDF MODULE

   1. Following the practice of Acrobar, the PDF module will accept
      the "%PDF-1.n" header comment anywhere in the first 1024 bytes of a
      file (with appropriate notification via an information message),
      rather than requiring that it start at byte offset 0.

   2. The requirements for the PDF/A profile have been brought into
      conformance with the most recent version of the PDF/A specification,
      ISO/DIS 19005-1 of 2004-12-22.

   3. Corrected bug that prevented valid PDF/X-1 files from being
      recognized as such.

WAVE MODULE

   1. Corrected error causing BitrateReduction to be incorrectly reported
      for uncompressed PCM audio.

XML HANDLER

   1. Dates reported for the NISO Z39.87 <tt><mix:DateTimeCreated>
      element are now canonicalized to be in proper ISO 8601 form.

   2. The NISO Z39.87 <tt><mix:ScannerManufacturer> element is now
      reported, if known.

AUDIT HANDLER

   1. The current working directory is reported as the "home"
      attribute of the <audit> element and individual files are reported
      as relative pathnames

************************************************************************

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0 (beta 3)
Rev. 2005-02-04

1 GENERAL

   1. The architecture has been modified to simplify the use of JHOVE
      with new "front ends." The new JhoveBase class is used in
      conjunction with the App class to incorporate nearly all the
      work of setting up a JHOVE instance. The main Jhove class and the App
      class are now smaller than before.

   2. Checksums were often being reported with incorrect values due to
      an output formatting error that dropped zeroes. This has been fixed.

   3. New utilities GDUMP and JDUMP created for GIF and JPEG documents.

   4. Error messages are more consistently factored into submessages.
      This allows messages indicating the same type of error to
      be more readily grouped.

   5. Some modules were reporting a MIME type for a document that is
      not well-formed. This no longer occurs.

   6. Duplicate reporting of AES BitDepth has been suppressed.

   7. New module for HTML format. Be sure to update the configuration
      file, jhove/conf/jhove.conf, to include the module:

        ...
        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.HtmlModule</class>
        </module>
        ...

   8. The AES audio metadata representation has been updated to
      conform with schema version 1.02b (pre-release).

   9. New property, sigMatches, has been added to RepInfo. This
      records which module(s) regarded the signature of the document as a
      match, even if the document was not well-formed. This is useful in
      identifying broken documents that are reported as ASCII or Bytestream.

  10. The logging API is supported, permitting the generation of
      debugging messages.

  11. All modules are now non-final, so that they can be subclassed by
      adventurous users.

  12. The -p and -P arguments of the command line are no longer
      supported.  Instead, the equivalent parameters can be
      provided to all variants of JHOVE (including those which
      don't take a command line) by specifying a <param> element
      within the <module> element of the configuration file.
      Example:

        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.PdfModule</class>
         <param>a</param>
         <param>f</param>
         <param>p</param>
        </module>

2 JHOVE COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE

   1. The JHOVE command-line interface can now accept directory names,
      as well as file pathnames and URIs:

        java Jhove [-c config] [-m module] [-h handler] [-e encoding]
                   [-H handler] [-o output] [-x saxclass] [-t tempdir]
                   [-b bufsize] [-l loglevel] [[-krs] dir-file-or-uri [...]]

      All of the files in the directories are processed in a
      depth-first recursive descent.

3 JHOVEVIEWER (SWING GUI) INTERFACE

   1. The JhoveViewer class now allows dragging of a directory or of
      multiple files, and the output for all files is presented in a single
      window. This significantly reduces the window clutter.

   2. The JhoveViewer presents the module menu in alphabetical order
      rather than configuration file order.

   3. The JhoveViewer was failing to report some submessages. This is fixed.

   4. The JhoveViewer was failing silently on certain URL errors; it
      now puts up an error alert.

   5. If an empty module class name is added in the Configuration
      dialog, it is ignored.

4 AIFF MODULE

   1. Descriptive properties added.

   2. Checksum was sometimes missing; fixed.

   3. Specification URL added to descriptive information.

   4. Reported MIME type changed to 'audio/x-aiff' from 'application/aiff'.

5 GIF MODULE

   1. BitsPerSample is now reported.

6 JPEG MODULE

   1. Errors occurring when parsing an optional EXIF segment were not
      being reported. This problem manifested itself by incorrectly
      reporting that the JPEG file is not well-formed.

   2. Array size bug in BitsPerSample fixed.

7 JPEG2000 MODULE

   1. Specification information added for ITU.

   2. Errors in parsing of an EXIF segment are now reported.

8 PDF MODULE

   1. In certain instances the module was inappropriately reporting
      well-formed PDF files as being non-well-formed, indicating
      (incorrectly) that the file does not contain a trailer.

   2. Fixed a NullPointerException being thrown with a defective page
      root tree.

   3. Certain broken cross-reference tables would throw the module
      into a loop. This is fixed.

   4. Problems in XMP data that triggered a SAX error were being
      reported to standard output as a "fatal error." They are now properly
      reported.

   5. Error in offset reporting fixed.

   6. Now reports FontFile2 and FontFile3.

   7. File trailers are now found more reliably.

   8. PDF/A profile updated to latest draft proposal, ISO/CD 19005-1
      (2004-09-20).

   9. Parameters that would have been specified by the -p argument 
      of the command line are now specified by the <param> element 
      in the configuration file. The sense of these parameters 
      has been reversed; by default, the PDF module presents
      the maximum amount of information unless suppressed by
      including the characters a, p, f, or o in the parameter value(s). 

9 TIFF MODULE

   1. Adobe DNG tags are recognized, and a DNG profile has been added.

   2. Bug in DATETIME checking fixed.

   3. Changes in validity tests for PhotometricInterpretation,
      SamplesPerPixel and BitsPerSample.

   4. Corrected spurious null values for some properties.

   5. Tag data type checking was badly broken, now fixed.

10 WAVE MODULE

   1. Type 'exif' recognized in LIST chunk.

   2. Format and signature information updated.

   3. Checksum was sometimes missing; fixed.

   4. Reported MIME type changed to 'audio/x-wave' from 'audio/x-wav'.

11 XML MODULE

   1. Now reports 1.0 and 1.1 as versions rather than profiles.

   2. Reported MIME type changed to 'text/xml' from 'application/xml'.

   3. A base URL for DTD's may now be specified using the 
      <param> element. The URL must be preceded by the letter b 
      to distinguish it from potential future parameters, e.g.,

        <module>
         <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.XmlModule</class>
         <param>bhttp://www.example.com/</param>
        </module>

12 XML HANDLER

   1. The "xsi" namespace is now defined in the NISO Image Metadata
      <mix:mix> and AES Audio Metadata <aes:audioObject> elements. This
      allows these segments to validate when extracted from the JHOVE output
      document.

   2. The <ImagingPerformanceAssessment> element is properly named; it
      had been improperly displayed as <ImagePerformanceAssessment>.

   3. X and YSamplingFrequency are reported as positive integers
      ("600"), not ratios ("600/1"), for consistency with the MIX schema.

   4. An empty Properties element in the XML handler is now suppressed.

13 GDUMP UTILITY

   1. New utility to dump GIF files in human-readable form. 

14 JDUMP UTILITY

   1. New utility to dump JPEG files in human-readable form. 

15 TDUMP UTILITY

   1. The output format has changed slightly, e.g.

       00000000: "II" (little endian) 42
        00000008: IFD 1 with 15 entries
        00000034: 254 (NewSubFileType) LONG 1 = 0
        00000046: 256 (ImageWidth) LONG 1 = 2948
        00000058: 257 (ImageLength) LONG 1 = 4620
        ...

RELEASE NOTES FOR JHOVE 1.0 (beta 2)
Rev. 2004-07-19

1. GENERAL

  1.1 Multiple files can now be specified in command line.

         jhove ... [[-krs] file-or-uri ...]

      set of files specified in a command line.

  1.2 API version information is now available through methods in the
      App class.

  1.3 AESAudioMetadata property has been added for sound formats. The
      new PropertyPath class facilitates the extraction of Properties
      by applications that use the JHOVE API.

  1.4 The ErrorMessage and InfoMessage classes now support a submessage
      string for more flexible message factoring.

  1.5 The SAX parser class may now be specified in the jhove.properties
      file in the property "edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.saxClass".

2. GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE (JhoveView)

  2.1 Supports drag and drop of directories; subdirectories are
      processed recursively.

  2.2 The menu option "File > Close document windows" closes all document
      windows.

3. MODULES (GENERAL)

  3.1 Performance has been improved in all modules.

  3.2 New modules for JPEG 2000, AIFF, and WAVE formats.  Be sure to
      update the configuration file, jhove/conf/jhove.conf, to include
      these modules:

        ...
        <module>
          <class>edu.harvard.hul.ois.jhove.module.AiffModule</class>
        </module>

      suppressed.

  9.2 <PlanarConfiguration> element was inappropriately nested underneath
      the <Segments> element.

  9.3 The "subMessage" attribute is now properly defined in the jhove.xsd
