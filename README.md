# SimpleDocumentManagement
This short script should install a complete Document Management System on a Raspberry Pi ( Wheezy ) or other Debian based Systems. This script takes only care of the installation Process from other tools. At the End, i hope,  you can access all your scanned Documents via Webbrwoser and you can search for words and strings. 

IMPORTANT NOTE:

If all works fine, you can access your Scanned Files via Http. Take care that you never releaser your Stuff to the Internet!
